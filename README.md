# KwikTrust
Hi, i have automated the KwikTrust Web application

#CreateProject.py
This code uses the Selenium webdriver to automate the login process on a website and create a project. 
After importing the necessary modules, the setURL() function is defined to open the website, maximize the window, and navigate to another page. 
The createproject() function is then defined to create a project with a specified name and logo.
